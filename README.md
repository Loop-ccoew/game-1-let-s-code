We are going to include the Hollywood game in this project.
The game is that, we have a movie set by us.
There are some of the missing letters in it , which will be displayed.
User has to guess randomn letters and find out the movie.
eg:
--G-A-
you have 9 lifelines .
If u enter a correct letter, the position of the letter in then movie will be displayed.
If you enter a wrong letter, u lose 1 chance amongst 9.
At the end, if you lose all 9 chances, you lose and the correct word would be displayed.
If you win before those 9 chances, that's greaat! :)
Enjoy playing 'HOLLYWOOD' !
